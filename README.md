Solves a particular variant of mTSP using a genetic algorithm.
Uses Google Maps API to get traffic times and display routes.

The Main.java class in the GUI package runs the program, wherein
you may enter a home as well as several addresses to visit.  The
algorithm by default will attempt to split the loops into sets of
5 houses each, but a custom set of loops may be entered.  This
application also requires a Google Maps API Key, which can be
acquired through Google or by my permission I can lend my own for
use.
